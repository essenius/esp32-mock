# esp32-mock

Mock implementation of common ESP32 functions so applications can be tested without a physical device.

Not everything is implemented - just the functions I needed so far for my own projects.

It can be used using vcpkg with the [vcpkg registry in this account](../vcpkg), port esp32-mock.
